A Unix CLI tool with a TUI for switching between DNS server profiles.

## Features

- **Named DNS profiles** - Define profiles like "home", "traveling", "work" with different DNS servers
- **TUI interface** - ncurses-style terminal UI using Bubble Tea
- **Clear DNS** - Revert to DHCP defaults with a single keypress
- **Multiple network services** - Switch between Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and other interfaces
- **DNS cache flushing** - Automatically flush DNS cache after changes
- **`/etc/hosts` management** - Headless `dnsctl hosts` subcommands to list/add/update/remove local hostname mappings, with JSON output for scripts and agents
- **Privileged helper** - Optional root daemon for password-less DNS/hosts changes without `sudo`
- **Desktop GUI** - Optional [Wails](https://wails.io) (Go + TypeScript) frontend on the same core (see [Desktop GUI](#desktop-gui-wails))

## Installation

### Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nycjv321/dnsctl.git
cd dnsctl

# Build
make build

# Install to /usr/local/bin (requires sudo)
make install
```

### Quick start

```bash
# Create config from example
make config

# Run the tool
make run
# or
./bin/dnsctl
```

## Configuration

Configuration is stored at `~/.config/dnsctl/config.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
default_service: "Wi-Fi"

profiles:
  home:
    description: "Home network with Pi-hole"
    servers: ["192.168.1.100", "1.1.1.1"]
  traveling:
    description: "Use network's DNS (DHCP)"
    dhcp: true  # Clears DNS settings to use DHCP
  cloudflare:
    description: "Cloudflare DNS"
    servers: ["1.1.1.1", "1.0.0.1"]
  google:
    description: "Google Public DNS"
    servers: ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"]

settings:
  flush_cache: true
```

### Profile Options

Each profile supports these fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `description` | Human-readable description shown in the TUI |
| `servers` | List of DNS server IP addresses |
| `dhcp` | Set to `true` to clear DNS and use DHCP (automatic) |

Use `dhcp: true` for profiles where you want to use the network's default DNS (useful when traveling or on networks with captive portals).

## Usage

Launch the TUI:

```bash
dnsctl
```

### Keybindings

#### Main Screen

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `p` | Switch DNS profile |
| `c` | Clear DNS (use DHCP) |

## Managing `/etc/hosts` entries

The `dnsctl hosts` subcommand manages local hostname mappings (e.g. pointing
`myapp.local` at `127.0.0.1`) from the command line — handy for scripts and
LLM/agent invocation where the interactive TUI isn't appropriate.

dnsctl only ever edits its own **managed block**, delimited by sentinel
comments. Everything outside that block — `localhost`, `broadcasthost`, and any
lines you added by hand — is preserved exactly:

```
# BEGIN dnsctl (managed by `dnsctl hosts` — do not edit by hand)
127.0.0.1	myapp.local	# dev box
10.0.0.5	staging.api api2.local
# END dnsctl
```

### Commands

```bash
dnsctl hosts list                                   # list managed entries
dnsctl hosts get myapp.local                        # show one entry
dnsctl hosts add myapp.local 127.0.0.1              # add (fails if it exists)
dnsctl hosts set myapp.local 127.0.0.1              # add or update (idempotent)
dnsctl hosts rm  myapp.local                        # remove an entry
```

Writing `/etc/hosts` requires root, so run the mutating commands with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo dnsctl hosts add staging.api 10.0.0.5 --alias api2.local --comment "staging"
```

### Flags

| Flag | Commands | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--json` | `list`, `get` | Emit JSON instead of a table |
| `--file PATH` | all | Operate on a different file (default `/etc/hosts`) |
| `--alias NAME` | `add`, `set` | Additional hostname for the same IP (repeatable) |
| `--comment TEXT` | `add`, `set` | Trailing comment for the entry |
| `--dry-run` | `add`, `set`, `rm` | Print the resulting file without writing |
| `--flush` | `add`, `set`, `rm` | Flush the DNS cache after writing |

Reads (`list`/`get`) don't need elevated privileges; only writes do. Before each
write the current file is backed up to `<path>.dnsctl.bak`, and the new content
is written atomically (temp file + rename) so an interrupted run can't corrupt
`/etc/hosts`.

## Privileged helper (password-less changes)

Changing DNS settings and writing `/etc/hosts` require root. The CLI can just be
run with `sudo`, but the **GUI cannot elevate itself** — so for the GUI (and for
a password-less CLI) you install the **dnsctl-helper**: a small root LaunchDaemon
that performs the privileged work on your behalf.

### Workflow

**1. Install once (the only time you enter a password):**

```bash
make build-helper
```
```bash
sudo make install-helper
```

This registers the helper as a root LaunchDaemon (launchd starts it and keeps it
running across reboots) and authorizes *your* user. To remove it later:

```bash
sudo make uninstall-helper
```

**2. After that, run dnsctl or the GUI as your normal (non-root) user.** Writes
are forwarded to the already-running helper and applied without a password
prompt. You never run the GUI with `sudo`.

### How privileged operations are routed

| How you run it | Mechanism | Helper required? | Password? |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| GUI (always non-root) | forwarded to the helper | **Yes** (writes fail without it) | No, after install |
| `dnsctl …` (non-root) | forwarded to the helper | Yes, for writes | No, after install |
| `sudo dnsctl …` | performed in-process | No | Yes, per `sudo` |

Reads (`hosts list`/`get`, DNS status) are unprivileged and never touch the
helper. If a write is attempted unprivileged with no helper installed, you get a
clear connection error.

### Security model

The helper is the trust boundary. The socket
(`/var/run/dnsctl-helper.sock`) is world-connectable; access is gated by a
**peer-UID check** (`LOCAL_PEERCRED`) — only root and the UID authorized at
install time may drive it. The helper restricts hosts writes to `/etc/hosts`,
validates DNS server IPs, and re-parses/validates hosts content before writing.
Set `DNSCTL_HELPER_SOCKET` to point a client at a non-default socket.

> **Tradeoff:** once installed, *any* process running as your user can change DNS
> and `/etc/hosts` (via the root helper) **without a password**. This is the
> deliberate cost of password-less convenience. If you'd rather authenticate per
> change, skip the helper and use `sudo dnsctl …` (CLI only).

> Note: for source/Homebrew installs the helper runs unsigned, which is fine
> locally. Distributing a notarized app would additionally require code-signing
> the helper (and, for a bundled GUI, registering it via `SMAppService`).

## Desktop GUI (Wails)

An optional desktop GUI lives in [`gui/`](gui/), built with
[Wails](https://wails.io) (Go backend, TypeScript frontend). It binds
`guiapi.App`, which sits on the same `internal/service` facade as the CLI and
TUI, so all three share one core. The GUI is a **separate Go module** (its own
`go.mod`) so the Wails/CGo dependency tree stays out of the main build.

It's a System Settings-style window with:

- **DNS Status** — read-only. Lists each network service with its current DNS
  servers (or "Automatic (DHCP)"), and marks the active/default-route service
  with an "Active" badge. dnsctl reads but never changes this configuration.
- **Hosts** — add, view, and remove the dnsctl-managed `/etc/hosts` entries.
- **Settings** (gear icon) — appearance (Light / Dark / System), font
  (System / Rounded / Mono, with live previews), a few host options ("show
  read-only system entries", "confirm before removing"), and a **helper
  status** indicator that tells you if `dnsctl-helper` is reachable (and how to
  install it if not). Preferences are remembered between launches.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24+ and Node.js + npm
- The Wails v2 CLI — install it, then verify system dependencies with
  `wails doctor`:
  ```bash
  go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/cmd/wails@latest
  wails doctor
  ```
  `go install` places the binary in Go's bin directory (`$(go env GOPATH)/bin`,
  typically `~/go/bin`). If `wails doctor` reports `command not found`, that
  directory isn't on your `PATH`. Add it (zsh):
  ```bash
  echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"' >> ~/.zshrc
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```
- The privileged helper, since the GUI runs unprivileged and forwards changes
  to it:
  ```bash
  make build && make install-helper
  ```

### First-time setup

Resolve the Wails dependency tree, then generate the TypeScript bindings for
`guiapi.App` into `frontend/wailsjs/`:

```bash
cd gui
go mod tidy
wails generate module
```

### Run / build

`wails dev` runs a hot-reloading development build; `wails build` produces a
production app at `gui/build/bin/dnsctl-gui.app`:

```bash
cd gui
wails dev
```

```bash
cd gui
wails build
```

See [`gui/README.md`](gui/README.md) for architecture details and how to add
new bound methods.

> Tip: copy commands without the surrounding comments. In an interactive zsh
> shell, `#` is not treated as a comment by default, so a pasted
> `go mod tidy   # ...` runs with the comment as arguments and fails.

## Permissions

Changing DNS settings on macOS requires appropriate permissions. You may need to:

1. Run with `sudo`:
   ```bash
   sudo dnsctl
   ```

2. Or grant your terminal Full Disk Access in **System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access**

3. Or install the [privileged helper](#privileged-helper-password-less-changes)
   for password-less changes without `sudo`.

## How It Works

dnsctl uses macOS `networksetup` commands under the hood:

```bash
networksetup -listallnetworkservices          # List services
networksetup -getdnsservers Wi-Fi             # Get current DNS
networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 1.1.1.1     # Set DNS
networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi empty       # Clear (use DHCP)
dscacheutil -flushcache                       # Flush DNS cache
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
make test              # Run all tests
go test -v ./...       # Verbose output
go test -cover ./...   # With coverage report

# View coverage in browser
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./... && go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

The project has comprehensive test coverage:
- **Config tests** - Config loading, parsing, defaults, and profile helpers
- **TUI tests** - Model initialization, message handling, key navigation, DNS operations
- **View tests** - Rendering output for all views

Tests use a mock DNS client (`internal/dns/mock.go`) to avoid requiring system access.
